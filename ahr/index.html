                    <p class="c-white">With so much uncertainty in the markets, investors seeking safe havens for their money have been pouring funds into government-backed bonds. Government bonds are traditionally seen as low-risk investments - however, their return has been low for quite some time. And with Brexit, Covid-19, and the Bank of England holding interest rates, the expectation is that the yields will remain low for quite some time. </p>
                    <p class="c-white fw-medium">As a result, Cash Equivalent Transfer Values (CETV) for Final Salary Pension Schemes have hit new highs. </p>
