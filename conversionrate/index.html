          <h2>Performance-based pricing</h2>
          <p>Majority of other CRO agencies don’t give any guarantees on SAAS retention optimization results and simply charge fixed monthly fee avoiding any uplift responsibility</p>
          <p>We estimate potential growth opportunities before we accept the client in order to forecast specific percentage of growth of retention that we guarantee with deadline. For example, it could be 12% total retention in 2 month.</p>
          <p>This promise forecast of guaranteed results is based on our experience of conducting A/B tests on million monthly users of our clients in SAAS and understanding of retention benchmarks</p>

          <p>There are three main characteristics to consider when you evaluate the expertise of a CRO agency:</p>
          <ol class="list-num">
            <li>process expertise</li>
            <li> business model expertise</li>
            <li> industry.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>All CRO agencies claim to have a CRO process expertise and tell the same story about skills in the research and A/B testing. And the client team should have some hard skills to understand the depth of this expertise on the interview stage which could be hard to do. What to do if you can’t do a technical interview on data engineering, experimentation, data analytics, statistics?</p>
          <p>So the next step would be to ask for the experience in the same business model, as all {business model} businesses share lot’s of similar pain points, optimization areas, analytics frameworks, best practices. Isn’t that helpful, if the agency already conducted the research on millions millions of users in order to get data on how to optimize {metric}?</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, different business models typically have completely unique tech and analytics stack that require completely different skills, processes and mindset. And if you hire an agency for the expertise you don't want the agency to do some things second time or quickly hire new team members or freelancers to fill-in the gap, right?</p>
          <p>And the last but not the least is the industry expertise which is mostly about understanding your unique users' needs. And that’s the main area of the research if the agency already has the business model expertise. So it’s definitely a killer advantage if the agency has that, but it dramatically narrows down the pool of contractors that have all three pillars (process, business model, and industry).</p>
          <p>But if the agency worked with 327 clients like we did, then the most likely had the experience in the same industry. And if such industry expertise is from different business model it could be even more valuable as uncovers the new growth hacks and tactics that your competitors may be not aware about</p>
